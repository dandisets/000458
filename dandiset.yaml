description: 'In this set of experiments, we recorded neural signals using an electroencephalography
  (EEG) array and Neuropixels probes while directly electrically stimulating the cortex
  in awake and anesthetized head-fixed mice. Details of the experiments can be found
  in the associated manuscript (Claar, Rembado et al., 2023). Briefly, the recordings
  and stimulation commenced while the mouse was awake, free to rest or move on a rotating
  disc. After delivering a series of stimuli, anesthesia was induced with isoflurane
  (5% via inhalation). Once a surgical level of anesthesia was reached, the mouse
  was maintained unconscious (1-1.5% isoflurane) during the delivery of another series
  of stimuli. In some subjects another series of stimuli was delivered after the isoflurane
  was turned off, this epoch/state is referred to as “recovery” in the dataset.


  Each session file includes the following data: raw EEG signals from all 30 surface
  electrodes and the associated electrode information; raw LFP signals from all electrodes
  on all Neuropixels probes (if used) and the associated electrode information; spike
  times for all units (spike sorted with Kilosort 2.0) that passed our quality threshold
  with associated information (brain region, spike waveform duration, etc.); subject’s
  speed computed from the rotation of the disc for the entire session; epochs marking
  when isoflurane was induced and when it was maintained; and a trial table containing
  information about every stimulus delivered throughout the session.


  All sessions included an awake and an isoflurane epoch, but not all sessions included
  a recovery epoch. Some subjects received visual stimulation trials (visual stimuli
  presented on a screen in the subject’s right field of view) interleaved with the
  electrical stimulation trials.'
